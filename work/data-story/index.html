        <p>
            After Northwestern ended the Chicago Transit Authority 201 Ventra card program last June, the 201 bus ridership has dropped 
            significantly in the fall academic quarter. From September 2024 to November 2024, ridership was
            9,000 fewer on average compared to 2023.

            CTA 201 ridership appears to fluctuate with the academic year, peaking during the academic quarters and dipping during the summer months.

            The university cited that the Intercampus shuttle was sufficient to meet the needs
            of community members in an email last August. However, the Northwestern community appears to have made 
            use of the program, as the cancellation of the program appears to be correlated with a drop in ridership levels.

            Compared to the 2024 year at large, ridership is up
