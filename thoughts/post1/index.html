        <h1> How the CTA 201 Bus Ridership Story Was Produced</h1>
        <div class="date">March 3, 2025</div>

        <!-- methodology text -->
        <p> 
            To produce <a href="../../work/data-story/index.html">this</a> story, I used data from the Chicago Data Portal on <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Daily-Boarding-Totals/6iiy-9s97/about_data">CTA Ridership Levels</a>.
            As of March 3rd, 2025, the most recent ridership levels data is recorded for December 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            I exported the 201 bus route data inclusive from March 1, 2023 to December 1, 2024 and imported it into this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JLXg0JgvIBk-wtCewL3ai0G1G1tFtdPOEKme6jMxOJM/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</a>.
            Then I verified that Sunday ridership is indeed zero because the 201 bus doesn't operate on Sundays. The month total was also indeed the sum of the two weekday and Saturday ridership.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since bus ridership varies by month, a double line chart comparing 2023 and 2024 data would highlight the effect of the program on the difference in ridership. 
            I took the data from March through December of each year to leave a sizeable gap in the months before and after the Northwestern 201 ventra program ended on June 30, 2024.
